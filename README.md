Ansible playbook information

This was a crash course in order to create my first ansible playbook.

First steps:
- Create SSH key ed25519
    · Command to create SSH key: ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "username/identifier".
    · After you type this command, follow the prompts that are displayed.
- Create 2 Amazon EC2 instances with Debian.
    · Port 22 should be open on both instances.
- Install Ansible on your computer.
    · Command to install Ansible: brew install ansible.
